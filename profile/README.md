This project's goal is to create a community driven service which generates open data by directly listening to the radio communications of transport companies. So far we have been actively working on providing the software stack for the following two use-cases:

- Mapping and live visualization of public transport vehicle movement
- Infrastructure for collecting, hosting and distributing open data
