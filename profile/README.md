## Hi, we are Dump-DVB,

We are Marenz, Tassilo and 0xA and are university students.
In this project we are trying to give real time information about public transport to the public.
As you can probably gather, we are from Dresden, but looking to broaden our project to include other cities in Germany as well.
So far, that looks something like this: [Live Map](https://map.dvb.solutions/)

To achieve this, we put up a network of radio receivers across the city, which listens in on the signals sent out by public transport. 

To expand this project, we are looking for frontend-developers (good UI is hard, man) and testers for the full software-stack.
We are also interested in making our receiver-network tighter and putting it up in other cities, so if you would like a pretty little window decoration that listens to public broadcasts, shoot us an [email](mailto:dump@dvb.soltutions)!
Lastly, hardware isn’t free, so if you’d like to send us money or hardware from our wishlist, we would be very thankful!
